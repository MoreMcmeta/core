Animate almost any texture with more options.

This means:
* more possibilities for resource packs
* [a familiar animation format](https://github.com/soir20/MoreMcmeta/wiki/User-Docs:-Animation-Format)
* not invasiveâ€”better compatibility with other mods

### Build
MoreMcmeta uses Gradle and the [Architectury Plugin](https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin) for cross-mod loader builds. However, it does not use the Architectury API. There simply isn't enough boilerplate code that MoreMcmeta needs to justify another dependency. JUnit is the unit testing framework.

There's a lot of build tasks, but the important ones are the `build` and `test` tasks under `common` (cross-loader), `forge`, and `fabric`. These correspond to MoreMcmeta's three source directories/Gradle subprojects.

* The `build` task generates a finished mod in `fabric/build/libs` or `forge/build/libs`.
* The `test` task runs unit tests for the given directory. The best way to view code coverage is to run the task for all subprojects and add the results together.

If you've set up a modded Minecraft environment before, MoreMcmeta is not much different. Gradle will do most of the work after you import the project.

### Run
After you import the Gradle project, the Architectury plugin should automatically generate run configurations for the client and server on Forge and Fabric. MoreMcmeta is a client-sided mod, but the server tasks are important to verify that it does not crash a dedicated server.

### Release
View built releases at the [Releases](https://github.com/soir20/MoreMcmeta/releases}) page. Generally, this page has exactly the same versions as CurseForge. Stable development builds may be there in the future.
