With **MoreMcmeta**, animate Minecraft mob, armor, GUI and more textures with the `.mcmeta` format—just like block and item textures.

This means:
* more possibilities for resource packs
* [a familiar animation format](#animation-format)
* not a coremod—better compatibility with other mods

## Install
1. Download and install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).
2. Create an installation and select the Forge version in the Minecraft launcher.
3. [Download](#download) MoreMcmeta.
4. Place the MoreMcmeta `.jar` file in your Forge installation's `mods` folder. There are no dependencies besides Forge.
5. Use the [trial resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/moremcmeta-demo) to see examples of animated textures.
6. If you're making your own textures, it's recommended you read the [Animation Format Guide](info/guides/ANIMATION-FORMAT.md). In particular, you need to use the `.moremcmeta` extension instead of the `.mcmeta` extension.

## Animation Format
See the [Animation Format Guide](info/guides/ANIMATION-FORMAT.md) for `.moremcmeta` file guidelines.

## Troubleshooting
